<h3>Causes of plastic pollution</h3>
<p>SINGLE-USE PLASTIC
Of all the plastic we use, 40% is used just once. Every year we use several billion items such as bags, bottles, trays, and food packaging. Supermarkets are full of it. Some people are careless with packaging and leave it behind as litter. But there are also places where people can’t do otherwise because there is no waste collection system. It is without a doubt that even if most people do their best, much of that single-use plastic enters the environment, being one of the biggest cause of plastic pollution.</p>
<p>OTHER CAUSES OF PLASTIC POLLUTION
It is not just about single-use plastic. Often people do not realize that they pollute the environment with plastic. For example, car tires are made of rubber and plastic which wears out while driving. That means that through this friction, thousands of microplastics get released onto the road and in the air. In addition, machine washing and drying of synthetic clothes let loose millions of microfibers into the drainage system. Personal care products and paint can also contain microplastics that wash away in wastewater. In addition, there is a kind of plastic which is also incorporated into cigarette filters and even into chewing gums.</p>
<p>THE PATHWAYS
Plastic carried by water flows downhill to the sea causes plastic pollution to reach the oceans. Rivers, for example, transport a lot of plastic to the sea. But that’s not the only way plastic moves around; it can also be transported by the wind. Even in gentle winds, plastic, which is very light, blows away – especially from landfill sites where it is dumped. Anyone who has launched a balloon can easily picture this. The plastic ribbons from balloons are often found on beaches – washed up, after landing in the water somewhere at sea.</p>

<h3>What can we do to stop plastic pollution</h3>
<p>1. Wean yourself off disposable plastics.
Ninety percent of the plastic items in our daily lives are used once and then chucked: grocery bags, plastic wrap, disposable cutlery, straws, coffee-cup lids. Take note of how often you rely on these products and replace them with reusable versions. It only takes a few times of bringing your own bags to the store, silverware to the office, or travel mug to Starbucks before it becomes habit.</p>
<p>2. Stop buying water.
Each year, close to 20 billion plastic bottles are tossed in the trash. Carry a reusable bottle in your bag, and you’ll never be caught having to resort to a Poland Spring or Evian again. If you’re nervous about the quality of your local tap water, look for a model with a built-in filter.</p>
<p>3. Boycott microbeads.
Those little plastic scrubbers found in so many beauty products—facial scrubs, toothpaste, body washes—might look harmless, but their tiny size allows them to slip through water-treatment plants. Unfortunately, they also look just like food to some marine animals. Opt for products with natural exfoliants, like oatmeal or salt, instead.</p>
<p>4. Cook more.
Not only is it healthier, but making your own meals doesn’t involve takeout containers or doggy bags. For those times when you do order in or eat out, tell the establishment you don’t need any plastic cutlery or, for some serious extra credit, bring your own food-storage containers to restaurants for leftovers.</p>
<p>5. Purchase items secondhand.
New toys and electronic gadgets, especially, come with all kinds of plastic packaging—from those frustrating hard-to-crack shells to twisty ties. Search the shelves of thrift stores, neighborhood garage sales, or online postings for items that are just as good when previously used. You’ll save yourself a few bucks, too.</p>
<p>6. Recycle (duh).
It seems obvious, but we’re not doing a great job of it. For example, less than 14 percent of plastic packaging is recycled. Confused about what can and can’t go in the bin? Check out the number on the bottom of the container. Most beverage and liquid cleaner bottles will be #1 (PET), which is commonly accepted by most curbside recycling companies. Containers marked #2 (HDPE; typically slightly heavier-duty bottles for milk, juice, and laundry detergent) and #5 (PP; plastic cutlery, yogurt and margarine tubs, ketchup bottles) are also recyclable in some areas. For the specifics on your area, check out Earth911.org’s recycling directory.</p>
<p>7. Support a bag tax or ban.
Urge your elected officials to follow the lead of those in San Francisco, Chicago, and close to 150 other cities and counties by introducing or supporting legislation that would make plastic-bag use less desirable.</p>
<p>8. Buy in bulk.
Single-serving yogurts, travel-size toiletries, tiny packages of nuts—consider the product-to-packaging ratio of items you tend to buy often and select the bigger container instead of buying several smaller ones over time.</p>
<p>9. Bring your own garment bag to the dry cleaner.
Invest in a zippered fabric bag and request that your cleaned items be returned in it instead of sheathed in plastic. (And while you’re at it, make sure you’re frequenting a dry cleaner that skips the perc, a toxic chemical found in some cleaning solvents.)</p>
<p>10. Put pressure on manufacturers.
Though we can make a difference through our own habits, corporations obviously have a much bigger footprint. If you believe a company could be smarter about its packaging, make your voice heard. Write a letter, send a tweet, or hit them where it really hurts: Give your money to a more sustainable competitor.
